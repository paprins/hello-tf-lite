# hello-tf-lite

Small Python repository of seamingly random scripts to do some [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) training.

Why TFLite? Because I just received a [Coral USB Accelerator](https://coral.ai/products/accelerator/) and I want to check out it's capabilities using a RPi 4.
